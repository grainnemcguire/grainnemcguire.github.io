&lt;p&gt;The lasso is applied in an attempt to automate the loss reserving problem. The regression form contained within the lasso is a GLM, and so that the model has all the versatility of that type of model, but the model selection is automated and the parameter coefficients for selected terms will not be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two applications presented, one to synthetic data in conventional triangular form, and another to real data.The secret of success in such an endeavor is the selection of the set of candidate basis functions for representation of the data set. Cross-validation is used for model selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lasso performs well in modelling, identifying known features in the synthetic data, and tracking them accurately. This is despite complexity in those features that would challenge, and possibly defeat, most loss reserving alternatives. In the case of real data, the lasso also succeeds in tracking features of the data that analysis of the data set over many years has rendered virtually known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A later section of the paper discusses the prediction error associated with a lasso-based loss reserve. It is seen that the procedure can be readily adapted to the estimation of parameter and process error, but can also estimate one component of model error. To the authors knowledge, no other loss reserving model in the literature does so. &#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my &lt;a href=&#34;/post/self-assembling-claim-reserving-models&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; for a tutorial on how to use the method described in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stochastic loss reserving using Generalized Linear Models</title>

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the monograph is to provide access to generalized linear models for loss reserving but initially with strong emphasis on the chain ladder. The chain ladder is formulated in a GLM context, as is the statistical distribution of the loss reserve. This structure is then used to test the need for departure from the chain ladder model and to formulate any required model extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chain ladder is by far the most widely used method for loss reserving. The chain ladder algorithm itself is non-stochastic, but Mack (1993) defined a stochastic version of the model and showed how a mean square error of prediction may be associated with any loss reserve obtained from this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, two families of stochastic model which generate the chain ladder algorithm for the estimation of loss reserve, as discussed in Taylor (2011). They require differing treatments of for the estimation of mean square error of prediction. Both families of model may be formulated as generalized linear models. This is not widely appreciated of the Mack model. The monograph commences with the identification of these two families and their respective GLM formulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLM formulation naturally invites the use of a bootstrap to estimate prediction error. The bootstrap estimates the entire distribution of loss reserve rather than just the mean square error of prediction obtainable from Mack’s algorithm. The monograph discusses both parametric and semi-parametric forms of the GLM bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasis is placed on the use of statistical software to implement the GLM formulation. This formulation and the associated software provide the diagnostics for testing the validity of the model. This aspect is covered by the existing literature but the monograph reviews this material in view of its importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical applications of the chain ladder often depart from the strict model. There are a number of causes but prominent among these are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need to smooth the age-to-age factor tail;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need to give greater weight to more recent data than to older.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two matters are considered within the GLM context. The subject of smoothing leads to a discussion of generalized additive models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regards the second point, the GLM structure is used to test whether or not data are time-homogeneous (as is required by the strict chain ladder model) and, if not, to suggest a procedure for recognising and accommodating time-heterogeneity in the data. This may lead to the common practice of discarding all but the last m diagonals of the claim triangle, but more general approaches are also be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time-heterogeneity is not consistent with the chain ladder model, it amounts to model failure, and is recognizable from the diagnostics introduced above. Various forms of model failure are considered and, in each case, a model extension constructed to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, extension to several models that go beyond the scope of generalized linear models is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my &lt;a href=&#34;/post/traditional-style-reserving-using-glms&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; for some R code on how to fit the GLM described in the monograph.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Individual claim loss reserving conditioned by case estimates</title>
      <link>/publication/2008_bootstrap/</link>

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines various forms of individual claim model for the purpose of loss reserving, with emphasis on the prediction error associated with the reserve. Each form of model is calibrated against a single extensive data set, and then used to generate a forecast of loss reserve and an estimate of its prediction error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of this is a model of the “paids” type, in which the sizes of strictly positive individual finalised claims are expressed in terms of a small number of covariates, most of which are in some way functions of time. Such models can be found in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the current paper is to extend these to individual claim “incurreds” models. These are constructed by the inclusion of case estimates in the model’s conditioning information. This form of model is found to involve rather more complexity in its structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the particular data set considered here, this did not yield any direct improvement in prediction error. However, a blending of the paids and incurreds models did so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loss reserving with GLMs: a case study</title>
      <link>/publication/2004_cas_glms/</link>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;This paper provides a case study in the application of generalised linear models (GLMs) to loss reserving. The study is motivated by approaching the exercise from the viewpoint of an actuary with a predisposition to the application of the chain ladder (CL). The data set under study is seen to violate the conditions for application of the CL in a number of ways. The difficulties of adjusting the CL to allow for these features are noted (Section 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regression, and particularly GLM regression, is introduced as a structured and rigorous form of dat analysis. This enables the investigation and modelling of a number of complex features of the data responsible for the violation of the CL conditions. These include superimposed inflation and changes in the rules governing the payment of claims (Sections 4 to 7). The development of the analysis is traced in some detail, as is the production of a range of diagnostics and tests used to compare candidate models and validate the final one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this approach are dicussed in Section 8&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
