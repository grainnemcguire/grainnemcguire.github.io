&lt;p&gt;This paper provides a case study in the application of generalised linear models (GLMs) to loss reserving. The study is motivated by approaching the exercise from the viewpoint of an actuary with a predisposition to the application of the chain ladder (CL). The data set under study is seen to violate the conditions for application of the CL in a number of ways. The difficulties of adjusting the CL to allow for these features are noted (Section 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regression, and particularly GLM regression, is introduced as a structured and rigorous form of dat analysis. This enables the investigation and modelling of a number of complex features of the data responsible for the violation of the CL conditions. These include superimposed inflation and changes in the rules governing the payment of claims (Sections 4 to 7). The development of the analysis is traced in some detail, as is the production of a range of diagnostics and tests used to compare candidate models and validate the final one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this approach are dicussed in Section 8&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
