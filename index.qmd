### Other code snippets

I'm part of the [IFoA Machine Learning in Reserving Working Party](https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/post/foundations/python-glms/). On our blog we share a lot of code examples in both R and Python, so check that out if you'd like to see some more useful material.
