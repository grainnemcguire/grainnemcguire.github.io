## About

I'm a statistician and actuary, with a long-standing interest in using statistics and machine learning in various areas including insurance, government and corporate work. 
I'm also concerned about the appropriate and fair use of these tools.

My original background was in statistical molecular genetics where I used statistical models to detect recombination in bacteria and viruses. As part of that I had to write C and C++ programmes to implement my methods which led me to develop a lifelong interest in the use of coding to implement novel statistical techniques.
